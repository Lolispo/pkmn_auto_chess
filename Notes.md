## Current Notes

Font Rockwell

Mana gain for lower hp units
  Is it possible for some units to do spells even?

Guarantee 2 tiers for every unit
  Legendaries Level 2 versions

Eevolutions removes lot of hp

is Money laundring ok with bugs?

Buffs between types?
  Themes of pokemon icons?
    Ash bonus (many different types)
    Brock = vulpix + ground/rock (dont know if good)

Level 5 unit upgrades?
  3 zapdos for example => uber zapdos
  Idea for upgrades: 
    Give Zapdos 2 and 3 with improved stats based on percentage of their skills
    For stage 2 units: either upgrade between units (stats on half between evos) or above with improved based on perc
      Could also add for tier 1 if base unit is strong
    No fix for 3 upgrade (might require balancing)
    -
    Would require more interesting infopanel to the left to check upgrade stats
    Star information on units, behind unit gif, not in battle
      One star top left, two stars to the side, one big star and 2 to the side for 3
      Easier indication between pikachu 1 and 2

Flying longer movement
  Assasins?

Speed might be too strong atm
    Buff tanky units

clear chat after a while?

sp.atk addition
  Defense guys buff both def and sp.def
  Dragon -> +sp.atk
  Psychic -> Decrease Enemy damage

Poison
  Apply poison prio to units that aren't poison
  Stack poisons?

DotDamage effect - Arvid had idea for visual effect
